# LYNX.exe Server-Side Executor

## How To Use
Begin by opening any executor, such as Hydrogen, KRNL, etc. Once it has loaded, inject it into a game on Roblox, and execute the following code:
```require(18410334661).load(YOUR-USERNAME)```
Make sure to replace YOUR-USERNAME with your actual Roblox username.

Once you see the LYNX.exe HUD, you are done launching LYNX.exe!

There are also buttons on the side which you can click, and then click the "Execute" button to run that exploit!

As of now, there are only 2 buttons:
* Infinite Yield
* HD Admin Ranker
* VAPE

More will be added soon!

* Please keep in mind that LYNX.exe is very new, and does not have all features yet, or stuff might not work *
