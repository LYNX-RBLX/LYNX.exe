# LYNX.exe Server-Side Executor

## How To Use
LYNX.exe can only be used with a backdoor in a game. Below is a link to our backdoor:
* [Backdoor1](https://create.roblox.com/store/asset/18410527712/HD-Admin)

Once you see the LYNX.exe HUD, you are done launching LYNX.exe!

There are also buttons on the side which you can click, and then click the "Execute" button to run that exploit!

As of now, there are only 3 buttons:
* Infinite Yield
* HD Admin Ranker
* DEX Explorer (2024 working)

More will be added soon!

* Please keep in mind that LYNX.exe is very new, and does not have all features yet, or stuff might not work *
